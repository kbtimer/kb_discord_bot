Behavior Expectations

Please reserve the general channel for tournament and server support questions.  This is the only text channel people can type in before they have a role, and we need to be able to find those messages if someone is having difficulties.

The lounge-text and lounge-voice channels are available for teams to use to communicate with other schools.

However, please be aware that these channels are public spaces with people of all ages and backgrounds.  Don’t type anything you wouldn’t be comfortable saying out loud in front of a crowd including younger kids as well as your coaches.

Below are some guidelines for behavior in those channels.  Violating these guidelines could result in being ejected from the tournament:

1. Be respectful.  Do not insult other people, other teams, other groups, other regions, meet officials, volunteers, etc.

2. Be appropriate.  Do not make posts of a sexual nature, make drug references, etc.

3. Be considerate.  The purpose of the channels is communication.  “Spamming” the channel with repeated or long messages intended to take space but not communicate reduces the usefulness of the channel for others and is not allowed.

Monitoring

Because the tournament is remote, we must rely on coaches to prevent cheating.  Coaches must have eyes and ears on their students during all rounds.  If a team is co-located, a coach can simply be in the room watching the team play.  If a team is remote, the coach must be watching the players over video chat, ensuring that the students are not seeking unfair advantage by means such as googling answers.  Please watch your alternates as well to ensure they’re not, for instance, texting answers to their teammates.

When teams cannot see each other, it is easy to imagine that another team is cheating.  To preserve the integrity of the tournament, we need to be able to check in with coaches and verify that they had eyes and ears on their students the whole time.  Allowing a team to play unmonitored is grounds for disqualification.

All schools must have a coach or sponsor available online throughout the tournament on the tournament server, no exceptions, so that they can be contacted by tournament officials as needed.  The coach or sponsor must join the competition room voice channel each round.  The reader will verify the coach’s presence via a verbal check-in during the microphone check at the beginning of each round.  Teams will not be allowed to play without a coach present and available.

Nicknames

Please change your nickname as follows:
Students: [*SchoolName*] *PlayerFirstName*
         OR:  ALT [*SchoolName*] *PlayerFirstName*
Coaches: *LastName* [Coach *SchoolName*]
Readers: *FirstName LastInitial* [Reader]
Timers: *FirstName LastInitial* [Timer]

Examples:
	An active player at Lincoln High might be "[Lincoln] Sidney"
	Upon subbing out for a round, Sidney becomes "ALT [Lincoln] Sidney"
	Coach might be: "Jones [Coach Lincoln]"

Student names must be accurate: Please use your actual name or the name you are customarily addressed by in a school setting.  Should a meet official need to speak to a coach about a player, the player’s nickname must accurately identify them to the coach.

To change your nickname on the server, go to the general channel and type, for instance:
 /nick [*SchoolName*] *FirstName*
(That is, begin the message with a forward slash followed by "nick" and a space.  Everything after that will become your nickname on the server.  Then press enter.)
